## 🔐 LOGIN & AUTHENTICATION (20 seconds)

*[Show login page]*

"First, let's log in. UniTrade requires UMass email verification, which means only verified students can access the marketplace. This creates a trusted, secure community. I'll log in as Naveen, a Computer Science student."

*[Log in]*

## 🏠 HOMEPAGE & STUDENT FAVORITES (30 seconds)

*[Show homepage]*

"Great! Here's our homepage. Right at the top, you can see our clean navigation - Browse, My Listings, Wishlist, and Messages. As an admin, I also have access to the Admin Panel.

Below, we have 'Student Favorites' - these aren't just random items. These are the most popular listings based on how many students have added them to their wishlist. This helps you discover what's trending on campus.

You can also browse by category - Electronics, Furniture, Textbooks, Bikes, Clothing, and Other items. Each category has its own icon for easy navigation."

---

## 🔍 BROWSE & SMART SEARCH (40 seconds)

*[Click Browse Listings]*

"Let's browse all available listings. Here you can see all active items for sale. Now, check out our AI-powered Smart Search feature.

*[Type in search box: "laptop in good condition under 500"]*

Instead of just matching keywords, our system understands natural language. When I search for 'laptop in good condition under 500', it automatically extracts the category, condition, and price range. The AI processes the query and shows relevant results.

*[Show filters]*

We also have traditional filters - you can filter by category, condition, status, and price range. You can combine multiple filters for precise results."

---

## 📦 VIEWING A LISTING (30 seconds)

*[Click on a listing]*

"Let's look at a specific item. Here's a smartwatch listing. You can see multiple product images, a detailed description, the seller's information including their major and location on campus, and the price.

Notice the seller information shows their pronouns, major, and campus location - this builds trust and community. You can see when they joined and their profile details.

If I'm interested, I can add it to my wishlist by clicking the heart icon, or I can message the seller directly."

---

## 💬 MESSAGING SYSTEM (25 seconds)

*[Click Message Seller]*

"Our built-in messaging system lets buyers and sellers communicate securely within the platform. All conversations are organized by listing, so you can easily track discussions about different items. Messages are real-time, and you'll get notifications for new messages. This keeps everything in one place - no need for external apps or sharing personal contact information."

---

## ❤️ WISHLIST (25 seconds)

*[Navigate to Wishlist]*

"Here's my wishlist - items I've saved for later. This is perfect for comparing options or waiting for the right time to buy. 

An important feature: the wishlist automatically filters out sold items. You'll only see available products here, so you're not wasting time looking at items you can't buy anymore. Each item shows the seller, price, and condition at a glance."

---

## 📝 CREATING A LISTING (35 seconds)

*[Click Post Item]*

"Now let me show you how easy it is to sell something. Click 'Post Item' and you're taken to the listing creation page.

*[Fill out form quickly]*

You can upload multiple images, add a title and description, select the category and condition, and set your price. You can choose between a Direct Sale or an Auction.

For auctions, you set a starting bid, bid increment, and end time. This creates excitement and can help you get the best price for your item.

*[Submit]*

And just like that, your listing is live! It appears immediately in the marketplace for other students to see."

---

## 🎯 AUCTION FEATURES (30 seconds)

*[Navigate to an auction listing]*

"Let's look at an auction. Here you can see the current bid, number of bids, and time remaining. 

*[Show bid leaderboard]*

The bidding leaderboard shows all bidders ranked by their highest bid. When someone places a bid, everyone viewing the listing sees it instantly - no page refresh needed. This is powered by WebSocket technology for real-time updates.

When the auction ends, the winner is clearly marked, and the seller can contact them directly to complete the transaction."

---

## 👤 USER PROFILE (20 seconds)

*[Click on Profile icon]*

"Every user has a profile where they can add personal information. You can see my major, campus location, pronouns, and bio. This helps build community and trust. When you're buying from someone, it's nice to know they're a fellow student in your area.

You can edit your profile anytime to keep your information current."

---

## 🛡️ ADMIN PANEL (40 seconds)

*[Navigate to Admin Panel]*

"Now let me show you the admin features. As an administrator, I have access to the Admin Panel for platform moderation.

*[Show Overview tab]*

The overview shows key statistics - total users, listings, active listings, and reports.

*[Click Listings tab]*

In the Listings tab, I can see all listings across the platform. I can view any listing, cancel active ones if they violate policies, or permanently delete problematic items.

*[Click Reports tab]*

The Reports tab shows user-submitted reports. Students can flag inappropriate or suspicious listings. When a listing gets multiple reports, it's automatically flagged for review. I can view the listing, dismiss false reports, or take action if needed.

This moderation system keeps the marketplace safe and trustworthy for everyone."

---
